        <h1>What we're about</h1>
        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>
          To foster a community of curious minds who explore the principles of
          game theory, mathematics, and strategic thinking inspired by John
          Nash, while promoting collaboration, innovation, and resilience in the
          face of challenges.
        </p>
        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p>
          To be a leading student hub that cultivates future thinkers,
          innovators, and problem-solvers who apply the lessons of John Nash’s
          work and life to create positive impact in academia, industry, and
          society.
        </p>
